# hello-world
I'm starting to love nerdy computer stuff

Who am I? My name is Ned. I can't sleep in my little bed. No matter how hard I struggle and fight,
my feet stick out of bed all night! And When I pull them in - oh dear! My head sticks out way up Here!

Jk that's about Sassan.

Love, 

Andrew
